In this project, the construction of a 3D model of the object (in the form of a photo with contours) based on slices at different heights (gradual immersion of the object into the contrast liquid) is implemented. 
For using this project you should paste your files in folder with this project and named this from 0 to amount of files minus 1 with file extension .jpg. First photo ("0.jpg") should be photo of object before immersion into the liquid and last photo should be object after full immersion.
There is two different modes. You can choose to use only OpenCV functions for finding contours or to use my own implementation.
